# Project: Accuracy of Student-t Distribution in Estimating Value at Risk (VaR)

## Description
In the complex world of financial markets, effective risk management is crucial. This project focuses on assessing the accuracy of the Student-t distribution in estimating the Value at Risk (VaR), a critical measure of financial risk.

## Problem Statement
The commonly used parametric method for VaR estimation relies on the assumption of normality in returns, which has limitations in capturing the reality of financial markets. How can we enhance VaR accuracy by adopting a more flexible approach, specifically using the Student-t distribution?

## Objectives
- Explore the impact of the Student-t distribution on the accuracy of VaR estimation.
- Highlight advantages compared to the standard parametric method.
- Understand how the Student-t distribution better captures the reality of market movements.
